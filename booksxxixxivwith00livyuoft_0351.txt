3. ad decuriatum aut centuriatum, “to be told off into

3. nescio (mmet, cum uhu-oppugnaturus. The sense ofthis

battle, but with the other at all times and places; against
Hannibal and his legions you will contend with your horse
and foot, but Varro will assail you at the head of your own
soldiers.’' In accordance with this, the whole passage may
be better arranged as follows: “ nescio, an infestior hic ad-

adversus Hannibalem legionesque ejus tuis equitibus ac
peditibus pugnandum tibi est: Varro dux tuis militibus
te est oppugnaturus.”—hz'c...ille‚ illo...hoc. Hie and hoc
refer here to Terentius: ille...illo to Hannibal. See Bk.
xx1v. ch. xxix. § 2.
