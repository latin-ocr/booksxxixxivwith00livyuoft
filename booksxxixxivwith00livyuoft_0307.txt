leading from the two passes of the Pennine and Graian
Alps. One of the main arguments alleged against Hanni-
bal’s passage by this route is, that his march does not ap-
pear to have been moleste& although the Salassians were
“the most untameable robbers of all the Alpine barba-
rians.’' (Arnold.)

XXXIX. 6. occupavit, “hastened‚” or “was first'' to
crOSS. Scipio crossed at Placentia, then ascended the left
bank by a bridge over the Ticinus. Hannibal was deseend-
ing the left bank to meet him.

XL. Scipio’s speech to his army. After apologizing·
sor addressing them at all, he tells them the nature of the
war they were commencing, with an enemy whom they
had osten before vanquished; who were reduced to mere
shadows by cold and famine, punishments which the gods
had sent upon them for their perfidy. These were not
mere words of encouragement, which he did not feel; his
presence there among them was proof enough of that; he
wanted to find out whether the last twenty years had really
produced different foes, or whether, after all, they were no
other than revolted slaves, whom he called upon them to
visit with just vengeance. He reminds them that they were
going to fight now, not for glory only, but the safety of
themselves, their samum, and their country.

1. a. supersedissem loqui, “ Ι should have forborne to ad-
dress y0u.''

b. Hispaniae provinciae scriptus, “levied for Spain.’'

c. meis auspiciis.- for he was consul. The protasis is
