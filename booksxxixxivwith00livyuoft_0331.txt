ch. viii.—x.] LIVY. 51

c. Luceriam. Luceria is about twelve miles due west of
Arpi. It was very important as a military post to the
Romans while Hannibal was in Apulia, serving either as
winter quarters for the army, or as head-quarters during
successive campaigns.

6. iterum. His first dictatorship was in 13.c. 221.

7. a. Veneri Eryciuae. Mount E1yx had been the scene of
one of the last successes of Rome in the first Punic war.
It was famous for its temple of Venus, founded, as was
said, by AEneas. This is the first mention of the worship
of Venus Erycina being introduced at Rome.

b. Menti. This is the earliest notice of any temple to
Mens. See Bk. xm. 31.

X. 1. de vere sacro. There are two instances in Roman
history of a ver sacrum,- the present, and one at the end of
this war. The sacrifice originally comprehended all that
was born of man or domestic animal during the two next
spring months, March and April; but on these two occa-
sions human beings were not included.

2. a. hisce duellis, specified by the following quod duellum
and quoe duella.

b. quive cis Alpes sunt. If quive be correct, the construc-
tion must be supplied, “ cum Gallis iisve qui,” διο. Qui is
usually read.

c. ἀπίω an old form of the conj. pres. for det.

d. profana, i. e. not already consecrated to any particular
god. So si id moritur...profanum, a little below, means
that if the animal died before the convenient time of its
being offered, no guilt was to accrue‚—it was to be con-
sidered as unconsecrate.

e. clepset, for clepsisset. Clepsit is commonly read, which
is for clepserit.—cui cleptum erit, “from whom it shall
have been stolen.‘’
