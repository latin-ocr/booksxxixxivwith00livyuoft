ch. xvii.-—xx.] LIVY. 15

Flaccus, had been sent on a previous embassy to Han-
nibal while he was besieging Saguntum, (ch. vi.).

5. a. quoniam discerniplacet : “ since you choose to have
a distinction drawn.''

b. necdum enim eraut. Livy remarks, in the next chap-
ter, that there was no clause limiting the provisions of the
treaty to the allies of each then being.

6. At enim eo foetlere. The Roman plea is anticipated—
“Yes, but you will say in the treaty made with Has-
drubal the Saguntines are expressly excepted.'' This treaty
was made in 13.c. 228.—e„rcipiuntur, meaning that the
Saguntines were expressly left a neutral state, (ch. 2,
ad fin.)

7, 8. The Carthaginian argument was that they were guilty
of no violation of any acknowiedged treaty in attacking
Saguntum. (1.) not of Lutatius's‚ for Saguntum was no-
where mentioned in it; (2.) as for Hasdrubal’s, they dis-
avowed it, on the same ground on which the Romans had
disavowed that of Lutatius. To this Livy replies in the
next chapter.

XIX. 2. comparandum non erat. The cases were en-
tirely different. The cases are—the refusal of the Romans
to acknowledge the treaty of Lutatius, and that of Carthage
to acknowledge the treaty of Hasdrubal. And, Livy con-
tends that there was no parallel between the two, because
in the treaty of Lutatius there was this clause, “ita id
ratum fore si populus censuisset,” whereas in Hasdrubal’s
there was no such provision.

3. priore foedere .- the treaty of Lutatius.

5, 6. Bargusios... Volcianos : two tribes of no importance
in the north—east of Spain.

XX. l. Iu iis, i. e. Gallis, or Galliis, if Gallias be
correct in the preceding chapter.
