the Roman calendar‚· but the Roman reckoning was pro-
bably six or seven weeks in advance os the true season.

b. copias flumen traduxit. Varro now led his forces across
from the larger camp on the south side of the river, and
formed a junction with the troops of the lesser camp. The
general course of the Aufidus is from south—west to north-
east, but near Cannae it makes a very large reach to the
south. . within the bend formed by this reach, on the
northern bank, was the battle-field. The larger Roman
camp was on the southern bank, about a mile hig-her up the
river than the lesser camp, which was 011 the northern
bank‚just where the bend to the south begins. Hannibal's
camp was at the south-eastern corner of the bend, a little
distance from the stream. When the two armies were
drawn up, Hannibal’s line faced nearly north, with its
flanks resting on the curve of the river. The Romans
stood on the chord of the are, facing nearly south. their
flankslikewise resting on the river. Arnold takes a different
view of the field of battle, and supposes that it was on
the southern side of the Aufidus, (see his History‚ vol. iii.
pp. 137—143‚) between Cannae and Canusium.

XLVI. 3. Gallis Hispanisque scuta ejusdem formae erant.
Their shields were long, but not wide.

4. alsus habitus : alins Ξ reliquus. See eh. lvi. note 4⁴.

6. Hasdrubal. His name does not occur after this time
in Polybius or Livy.

7. ventus...malt0 pulvere ἱη Ipsa ora volvendo. In this
part of Apulia the sea breeze rises pretty regularly at
noon. Niebuhr thinks it quite probable that Hannibal
may have so arranged his men as to take advantage of this
wind blowing the dust into the faces of the enemy. There
is a story that he even caused the ground to be ploughed5
but this is of course mere fable.
