d. populum liberum habiturum, sc. consulatum. The
meaning is that the people would hold the consulship at

their own free disposal.

XXXV. 1. C. Terentius consul unus creatur. There
were six candidates, but Varro alone of them all obtained
a sufficient number of votes in any tribe to be returned.

that no army was sent to Gaul in B.c. 215, with this.
Perhaps Matho was appointed to the province, but did not
obtain any troops that year.

b. P. Furius Philus had been consul with Flaminius
in 13.c. 223. He was now elected praetor peregrinus. He
