ΧΧΙΙΙ. 2. a. Nonaginta millia. Hannibal crossed the
Ebro with 90,000 soot and 12,000 horse, but his numbers
were reduced partly by heavy losses in reducing the
tribes between the Ebro and Pyrenees, partly by a detach-
ment of 11‚000 men whom he left with Hanno, and partly
by his sending back about 11‚000 of his Spanish soldiers,
so that he entered Gaul with not more than 50‚000 foot

and 9,000 horse. Pol. iii. 35. 7.

b. Ausetanos. These and the Lacetani were small tribes
at the foot of the Pyrenees.

c. Hannonem. Hanno's duty was to make good the oc-

Pyrenees, but Cn. Scipio lauded in Β.ο. 218, and before
Hasdrubal could come up to his support, Hanno was de-
feated and taken prisoner, (ch. lxi.‚) and his troops driven
across the Ebro.

d. fauces. There were three roads. 1. At the western
extremity of the range, near the coast over the Bidassoa
2. More to the east, leading from Caesaraugusta (Sara-

near the coast of the Mediterranean. By this last Hanni-
bal passed. Hasdrubal crossed afterwards by the western
route.
