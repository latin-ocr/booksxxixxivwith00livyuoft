XXI. 1. a. Mandonius Indebilisque. Two brothers. When
Hanno, in B.c. 218, was defeated and taken by Cn. Scipio,
Indibilis, who commanded the Spanish auxiliaries for him,
shared his fate, (Pol. iii. 76). It is not related how he
regained his liberty. In mc. 212 he led a force of 7,500
men to join Hasdrubal, the son of Gisco, and the attempt
of the Romans to intercept him brought on the battle which
ended in P. Scipio's defeat and death. When P. Scipio
Africanus took New Carthage, the wife of Mandonius and
the daughters of Indibilis fell into his hands, and his kind
treatment of them, compared with the haughty conduct of
Hasdrubal, won them in B.c. 209 to join the Romans with
all the forces of their nation. Three years after, the report
of the death of Scipio led them to revolt3 but Scipio
quickly defeated thern, and treated them with great cle-
mency. The next year (B.C. 205), Scipio having quitted
Spain, they revolted again, but were defeated by the gene-
rals whom Scipio had left. Indibilis fell in the battle
Mandonius escaped for a time, but was afterwards given
up by his followers to the Romans, and put to death.
