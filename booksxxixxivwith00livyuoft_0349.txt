ch. xxxv„ xxxvi.] LIVY. 69

Romans were victorious, but if they were, their losses were
so great that they were unable to follow up their victory,
and Hannibal remained still master os the country. The
next year, 13.c. 208, witnessed Marcellus‘ fifth consulship
and death. He had advanced from Venusia to reconnoitre
the enemy, fell into an ambuscade of Numidians, and was
ilain.

d. L. Postumius Albinus. The same who had been consul
in 13.c. 234, and again in ΒΑ). 229. He was elected consul
again for B.c. 215, but did not live to enter upon his office.
He and his army were destroyed by the Boii, in the forest
Litana. See Bk. xxm. ch. xxiv.

XXXVI. 1. a. numero...auctas. See Bk. xxr. ch. xvii.
4, a. In construction the sentence depends upon aliz* auc-
tores sunt. “They say also that the legions were augmented
in respect of the number of their foot and horse.” numero.
For this abl., see Madv. Lat. G„ ἓ 253. millibus is used
substandvely, “ a thousand foot.”

b. quadringeni equites. Some editions have treceni, but
three hundred was the usual number of cavalry in a
legion.

c. socii duplicem numerum equitum darent. It has been
doubted whether the cavalry of the allies was not treble
that of the Romans, instead of double. The doubt arises
from Polyb. iii. 107. 13, where he says that the infantry of
the allied contingents equalled that of the Romans, but
that their cavalry were generally thrice as numerous (ὣς
ἐπίπαν τριπλάσιον). But in another place, where he speaks
of the numbers of the legion (vi. 26. 7), the texts vary be-
tween τριπλάσιον and διπλάσιον, and on the whole it seems
likely that Livy’s positive statement here is to be accepted.

d. peditis oequarent, i. e. oequarent numerum peditis. Other

editions read pedites.
