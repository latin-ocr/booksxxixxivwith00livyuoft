At their first creation‚ there were teu interreges, but the
number was afterwards, at various times, increased. The
comitia were usually held by the second or third in the
succession, seldom by the first.

4. C. Terentio l'arrom'...lzon1iues. This sentence is ren-
dered difficult by the long· parenthesis. The whole may
be broken up in translation, and then the sense will be
clean—“Thea men might not grow accustomed by in-
veighing against them to think themselves as good as they,
(se...sz·bz' refer to patres), the patricians used all their
eff‹›rts to oppose the election of C. Terentius Varro. He
was one of the people’s own sort, and had become ingra-
tiated with them by his invectives against the aristocracy
and other devices for winning favour. From the shock
which had been given to Fabius's power as dictator, he
was now in the blaze of his glory at the expense of an-
other's popularity, and the commonalty were even exerting
all their strength to bring him out for the consulship.’'—-
aliena invidia, “by throwing odium on another,'’ in the
same sense as per invidiam eorum, a little belom—extra-
here .· see Bk. v. ch. xii„ ‘⁴ extractum ad tantuin honore1n.’'
An invidious word, “to drag him out,'’ as if by force,
though utterly unfit for it. But see ch. xxvi. 1, note.

5. a. id foedus, &eq “such was the league which had been
struck between all the nobles.’‘

b. hominem novum. A plebeian who first attained a.
curule office, was the founder of his fainily’s nobilitas.

Antiq., p. 799. a.

c. plebeios nobiles, opposed to hominem novum. Men of
plebeian origin, but whose ancestors lead held curule offices.
