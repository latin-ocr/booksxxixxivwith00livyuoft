After the capture of Pharos by L. AEmilius Paullus in
B.c. 219, Demetrius fied sor refuge to Philip, and became
his chief adviser. After the battle of the Trasymene lake,
he advised Philip to make alliance with Hannibal against
Rome. The completion of this was delayed by the cap-
ture of the Macedonian envoy Xenophanes (Bk. xxux. ch.
xxxiii„ xxxiv.), but was concluded in the year after the
battle of Cannae. The Roman demand for the surrender
of Demetrius by Philip was unsuccessful.

b. Pineum regem. Pincus was the son of the Illyrian
king Agron, who died in B.C. 231. At first he was left to
the guardianship of Teuta, his step-mother, but upon her
defeat by the Romans, he was committed to the care of
Demetrius. On the expulsion of Demetrius, the Romans
raised him to the throne, but obliged him to pay them
tribute.

6 interregem. The appointment of an interrex was a
very unpopular measure, because no plebeians were ad-
missible to the office. From this time there does not occur
another instance of an interregnum until [Le. 82, when an
interrex was appointed by the senate to hold the comitia
or Sylla's election to the dictatorship.

The authority of each interrex lasted for only five days.
