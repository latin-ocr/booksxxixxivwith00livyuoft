114 L1VY. [Bk. xx1v.

2. Sedecim millia. We should probably read εει sor
sedecim. Tne temple here alluded to was the most famous in
Magna Graecia. It was of very ancient foundation, pro-
bably Pelasgic, from the legends about it. Both Pyrrhus
and Hannibal left it inviolate, but in B.c. 175, Q. Fulvius
Flaccus profaned and robbed it, and it never recovered its
splendour.

5. per aversas rupes. See Bk. xxu. ch. xxiv. § 7.

IV. 4. filiae. These were Demarata, the wife of Andra-
nodorus, and Heraclea, wife of Zoippus. Hiero had also a
son, Gelo, who had married Nereis, daughter os Pyrrhus;
from her were born Hieronymus, and Harmonia, who be-
came the wife of Tliemistus.

5. a. quinquaginta annos. Hiero's allianee with Rome
began in B.C. 263.

b. disciplinoe, in apposition to vestigiis. Some edd. have
disciplinaque.

V. 3. a. convenientes, “ ofa piece with.'’

b. contemptus omnium hominum, “contempt for,’' objec-
tive genitive.

6. avertit...occurrere. “He turns away eondemnation
from those who were really privy to the plot upon the inno-
cent, (falsely declaring that Thraso was the author of the
plan‚—that none would have dared so great an enterprise
except as relying on so powerful a ehief‚) mentioning the
names of the most worthless of those about the tyrant's
person who occurred to him as he made up his story amid
his torture.'’ From Thrasonem to ausuros may be taken as
parentlietical. Then the only difficulty is in connecting
insontes with the last sentence, ab latere...occurrere. They
are really in apposition. But if we supply eos nominans,
or some such words, after ausuros, the whole becomes easy.

8. latuit, “ sought concealment.''
