tum senatorum and quemque5 both depend upon absump-
sissent.

4. a. postulatum Latinorum. Livy has already been re-
minded of this (see above, ch. vi.) by the demand of the
Campanians. Before hostilities commenced in B.c. 340,
the Latins tried to obtain a union of equality with Rome.
They were willing that Rome should be the seat of govern-
ment‚ and Romans the name of the united nation, but they
demanded that they (the Latius) should always surnish one

a second time. He was hence called Censorinus.

3. curulem magistratum gessissent. The right of using
a curule chair, or chair of state, belonged to the consuls,
praetorS, {curule aediles, censors, flamen dialis, and dic-

4. a. Ut quisque creatus erat, “when each of these ·
had been made a member of the senate according to his
rank.'’ This seems to be what is meant, but the text is
very doubtful.

b. civicam coronam. This passage would seem to give
the highest distinction to the attainment of the corona
