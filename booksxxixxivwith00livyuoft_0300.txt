tion of this Hanno. Polybius says he commanded the right
wing at Cannae, (Pol. iii. ll4; but compare note, cli. xii.)

b. adversoflumine‚ “up the river.‘’ So adversa ripa, ch.
xxxi„ opposed to secunda aqua, ch. xxviii„ “ down the
strea1n‚’' secundo aestzc, xxiii. 41, “down the tide,’⁷ “with
the tide in their favour.''

3. sine ulla mole, ‘⁶ without any ado.”

5. equites sere. The reading eques gives no sense. With
equiles the sense is, “ a line of vessels (arranged) some way
up the stream, so as to break the force of the current,
afforded the horsemen a means of crossing, with their horses
for the most part close at hand, swiniming alongside, and
at the same time made the water smooth sor the light boats
crossing lower down.'’

XXVIII. 5. ut quemque. The order is, “ipso impetu
fluminis rapiente (quemque) in alteram ripam ut vadum
destituerat quemque timentem altitudinem.” The ele-
phants were afraid to take the stream at once, but advanced
caufiously, until the water carried them off their legs, and
then the current of itself swept them to the other side.

6. a. id ut, “ this, as it would plainly be the safer course
is the thing had to be done (ante rem), so it is much more
likely that it was the one actually (acta re) adopted.¹’

b. applicatam, “lashed alongside.”

c. actuariis navibus, “ light towing boatS.”

7. a. donec continenti velut ponte agerentur, “as long as
they were driven along as on a bridge all one with the
land,’‘ i. e. before it was cast off from the bank.

b. a cceleris, i. e. ratibus, (Polybius speaks of several):
or elephantis may be supplied.

XXIX. 4. hand incruentam ancipitisque certaminis vic-
toriam, “success by no means bloodless‚ and only ob· l
tained aster a doubtful contest.'’
