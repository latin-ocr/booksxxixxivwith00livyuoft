Hamilcar and himself in Spain. It was near the south-
east extremity of Hispania Tarraconensis. Polybius, who de-
scribes the position ofthe city,intimates that it was built not
without a view to its becoming the capital of an indepen-·
dent kingdom, (x. 10). It was taken by P. Scipio B.c. 210.

c. obtruncat. B.C. 221.

6. a. foedus renovaverat. 13.C. 228. By this treaty the
Ebro was to be the northern boundary of the Carthaginian
empire in Spain. In the time of Hasdrubal itnever reached
sofar. Hannibal extended it greatly, so that at the break-
ing out of the war all Spain south of the Ebro and Douro
was Carthaginian. ’

b. mediis iuter imperia. Saguntum (Ζᾶκανθα, Polyb.) was
about half-way between the Ebro and Carthago Nova, on the
coast of modern Valencia. Its site is marked by the present
town of Murviedro, (muri veteres). Livy says (ch. vii.) that
it was founded by a colony from Zacynthus, the only
ground for which assertion was probably the similarity of
name.

III. 1. praerogativam militarem, “the choice of the sol-
diery;'’ an expression borrowed from the mode ot' elec-
tion at Rome. The tribe which first voted was called.
praerogativa tribus, and their choice was a kind of omen of
the result. Here the soldiers, without waiting for the ap-
pointment from Carthage‚ at once decided the matter by
their unanimous choice of Hannibal.

2. vioedum puberem, i. e. at the time of Hasdrubal’s in-
viting him to join him. Hannibal could not have been
less than eighteen years old when Hasdrubal took the
command, and he must have been twenty-three years old
at least when he complied with Hasdrubal's summons,
(sor he served the last three years of Hasdrubal’s eight
years of commandwith him, compare ii. ἓ 3, and iv.§ 10) ;
