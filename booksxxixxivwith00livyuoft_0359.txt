ch. l.-liii.] LIVY. 79

7. stricta, “drawn together‚¹’ “pinched3'

9. quos sibi...apparebat, “It was evident that they had
themselves made pits in the ground, and burying their
faces in the earth, had suffocated themselves.’'

10. exspirasset, sc. Romanus, although the change of sub-
ject is certainly very harsh.

LII. 1. Brachioflmninz' objecto eos excludit. A brachium
in military language means any outwork, whether a build-
ing or a ditch. Here the meaning is, that Hannibal, by
means of some work (probably a ditch) thrown between
the camp and the stream, shut the Romans out from the
river. Many editions have flumine, and change the order
of the words to brachio objecto, flumine eos excludit. If
flumini be retained, it must be taken after objecto.

3. pacti...acceperunt. The order of this sentence is very
much involved. It seems to be “pacti (sc. Romani) ut
arma atque equos traderent, et ut eo pretio persoluto
(nempe) in capita Romana trecenis nummis quadrigatis‚ in
socios ducenis, in servos centenis, cum singulis abirent
vestimentis, in castra hostes acceperunt.'' The nummi
quadrigatizsilver denarii, stamped with a quadriga,-
their value was about 85d. Sometimes the image osa biga
was stamped upon the coin instead of the quadriga. See

Bk. xx111. ch. xv.
5. nam ad vescendum facto perexiguo, vtique militantes,

utebantur. Esther, “ for they used very little table-plate‚
especially as they were engaged in active service ;” or, as
some render it more generally, “for men at that time,
especially when engaged in service‚’' &0-

LIII. 1. a. Fabius Maximus, elder son of Fabius Cunc-
tator. We find him praetor in ΒΑΕ. 214, (Bk. xxw. ch. ix.)
In B.C. 213 he was consul, and his father served as legatus
under him, (Bk. xx1v. ch. xliv.)
