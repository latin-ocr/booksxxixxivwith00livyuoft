themselves quite equal to those of Rome, and were con-

nected with them, even with the Claudii, by intermar1·iage.”

V. 2. quam poterat maxime miserabilem, “the most pite-
ous object possible.’' The superlative is signified in the
highest possible degree by this aud the like expressions,
quantum maxime, ut maxime combined with possum. See
Bk. xxu. ch.iv. ᾗ 5, “quantam maa-imam vastitatem po-
test.'’

7. a. sed etiam Sidicinum. There is some difficulty in
this, for the Campaniaus and Sidicines were in alliance,
and the Samnite was the common enemy. The war alluded

at Rome that the course of the Vergellus, a small torrent

the story told about Hannibal Monomaehus (Polyb. ix.
24. 6), who is said to have advised Hannibal to train his
men to eat human flesh, that they might not be in want of
provisions. Polybius attributes to Hannibal Monomachus
especially many of the cruelties which have been charged
upon the son of Hamilcar.
