ch. x.—xiii.] LlVY. 53

4. a. cogeret, sc. egredi.

4. b. minus...-poenitere‚ to think less badly of. But paeni-
tere is impersonal, and its construction must not be over-
looked. The order is, adsuefaciebant militem minus poenitere
(= ut minus poeniteret) militem, ᾇϊ. The second militem
must be supplied.

XIII. 1. “Hannibal finding that the Apulians did not
join him, recrossed the Apennines, and moved through
the country of the Hirpinians into that of the Caudinian
Smnnites.'’ Arnold‚ p. 119.

a. Beneventanum...agrum Beneventum, on the Via Appia,
about thirty miles east of Capua, originally a strong Sam-
nite city, had fallen under the power of Rome in the third
Samnite war, and was now a Latin colony. The Romans
gained two great successes in its neighbourhood in this war.
(i.) The defeat of Hanno by Gracchus, 13.c. 214, (xxiv. 14);
and (ii.) The storming of Hanno’s camp by Fulvius, 13.C.
212, (xxv. 14).

b. Telesiam urbem. Telesia is a few miles north-west of
Beneventum, near the right bank of the Calor, about three
miles from its junction with the Vulturnus. Fabius re-
covered it from Hannibal 13.c. 214, (xxiv. 20).

2. a. hi nuntiantes, tlxe verb is moverunt. Quum res major
quam auctores esset, “the importance of the object being
greater than the trustworthiness of his advisers.¹’ alteruis
fidentem ac dtffidentem, “ trusting and distrusting by turns.'¹

b. ut Campanos ex Samnio peteret. From Telesia, Hanni-
bal descended ‘⁶ the Calor to its junction with theVulturnus,
and ascending the Vulturnus till he found it easily sord-
able, he finally crossed it near Allisae, and passing over the
hills behind Calatia, descended by Cales into the mid-st of

the Falernian plain, the glory of Ca1npania.'' Arnold,
p. 119.
