8‚000 Spanish infantry, and 6,000 cavalry. This was the
number which Hannibal himself caused to be inscribed
upon the bronze tablet in the temple of the Lacinian Juno,
near Crotona, (Pol. iii. 56. 4.) If this be the correct num-
ber, he must have lost 33,000 men between the Pyrenees
and Italy.

3. L. Cincius Alimentus, was praetor in Sicily B.C. 209;
he was taken prisoner by the Cnthaginians, and well
treated by Hannibal, from whom he obtained an account
ofhis passage through Gaul and over the Alps. Niebuhr
gives him credit for considerable rese-arch.

‹1·. a. Taurinis .· a Ligurian people dwelling on the eastern
slope of the Alpes Cottiae: their limits are very uncertain.
This is the first time we hear of thern in history. Augusta
Taurinorum (Turiu) is the only one of their cities known,
and it was of a much later foundation.

b. quum inter omnes constet, ‘⁴ since it is allowed on all
hands.'’ This is by no means the case, for Polybius (iii.
56. 3) says that he descended among the Insubrians, and
mentions the Taurini subsequently (iii. 60. 8). Livy’s
argument, therefore, for the route of the Alpes Cottiae is
os no value.

c. Poenino: more correctly written Pennino, from the
Celtic Pen, “ a sunnnit.” The Romans worshipped Jupiter
under the name Penninus.

d. Coelium : L. Coelius Antipater, an historian, flourished
cir. ss.c. 120. He wrote a history of the second Punic war,
following the Greek of Silenus, who was a friend and at-
tendant of Hannibal. He is frequently quoted by Livy,
e.g. ch. xlvi„ xlvii.

e. Cremonis jugum: some part, not certainly known, of
the Alpes Graiae.

f. Salassos : a very powersul people, probably Ligurian,
occupying the valley of the Duria major (Dora Bellica),
