nibal’s previous route, as we should have expected, but the

b. Tricastinos...Tricorios. It is not possible to deter-
mine the exact limits of these peoples. Two rivers, the
Isara above, and the Druna below Valence, join the Rhone
from the east. Between these rivers lay the Tricastini,
near the Rhone‚ and the Tricorii, more to the east. The
Vocontii were farther south, between the Druna and the
Druentia. Hannibal, according to Livy, passed through
the Tricastini and Tricorii, skirting the Vocontii, until he
came to the (npper streams of the) Druentia. This route
would seem to have brought him to the Alpes Cottiae
(Mont Genevre). If he followed the valley of the Isara,
he must have corne to the Alpes Graiae (Little Sl. Ber-
nard) ,· and this on the whole is the most probable route.
