really only king of the westernmost tribe, the Massaesylii.
Being now at war with Carthage, he made a treaty with
the Seipios, and hythe help of Statorius having ‹lrilled
and disciplined his army, was enabled to gain a victory.
Their defeat camed the Carthaginians to recall Hasdrubal,
and make an alliance with Gala, king of the Massyliam,
who sent his son Masinissa with an army to llasdrnhal’s
support. Syphax was defeated once and again, and obliged
to sue for peace. In Ire. 210 he again formed allianee with
Rome, but was shortly after gained ovvr to Carthage hy
Hasdrubal, who gave him his daughter Sophonisba in inar-
riage. Masinissa now became the friend, and Syphax the
foe, of Rome, a change which finallyusnhed in the ruin of
the latter. After several defeats he was at last taken
prisoner and sent to Rome. He died, according to Livy, at
Tibur, just in time to be saved the mortilieation of adorn-
ing the triumph of Scipio at the end of the war.
