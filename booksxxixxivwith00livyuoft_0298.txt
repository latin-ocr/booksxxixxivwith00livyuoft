Transalpine Gaul into Umbria. The Romans having oc- '

cupi‹.-d the lands of the Senones, a war broke out between
them and the Boii in 225. The latter were defeated, but
remained hostile until 218, when, without waiting for Hau-
nibal, they attacked and defeated the Romans, who were
founding the colony of Placentia. Two years later they
destroyed the army of Postumius, (xxiii. 24). They were
ultimately reduced (B.C. 191) by Scipio Nasica.

b. Insubribus: a nation of the Gauls confederate with
the Boii. C. Flaminius crossed the Po and gained a great
victory over them in ss.c. ⁶223. In the following year Mar-
cellus and Cn. Corn. Scipio reduced thern to submission.
It was in this war that Marcellus killed the Gaulish chief
Viridomarus, and won the spolia opima.

c. Placentiam (Piacenza) .· on the south bank of the Po,
just below the influx of the Trebia. This is the earliest
mention of the existence of the town.

d. Cremona .· on the north bank of the Po, a little below
the confluence of the Addua—the sister city to Placentia.
Neither it nor Placentia were taken by Hannibal.

e. colonias .· one of the main objects of a Roman colony
was to keep the conquered people in check. The colonists
had all the rights of Roman citizens.

2. a. triumviri: comniissioners temporarily appointed at
Rome to execute any extraordinary office. Thus we find
triumviri memmii, xxiii. 21 ς triumviri reficiendis cedibus,
xxv. 7, διο.

b. Mutinam (Modena).· about seventy miles south-east
from Placentia. The Via AEmilia, which was made about
the year 13.c. 187, from Ariminum to Placentia, passed
through it. Mutina fell into Roman hands sometime in
the Gallio war, (irc. 225—222 .

c. C. Lutatius.- probably the son of that Lutatius whose
victory ended the first Punic war. lle was consul in ΒΛ). 220
