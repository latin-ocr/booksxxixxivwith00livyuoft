to cross the Timr, which he did near Perusia, to enter upon

taining its loyalty when other colonies were shewing dis-
affecflon, (xxvii. 9).

called by the Greeks Daunia.’¹ Arnold.

at the most critical period of the war, (xxvii. 10).

b. Arpos. After the battle of Cannae, this city was one of
the first to submit to Hannibal, and it continued in his

power until 13.c. 213, when it was betrayed to Fabius
Maximus, It never recovered from the lOsses it sustained

in this war.
