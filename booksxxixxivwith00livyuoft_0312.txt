of note on the west coast of Bruttium. There is no men-
tion ofit again until after the close of this war.

5. a. extemplo in naves impositum. Polybius (iii. 61) gives
a different account3 he says that Sempronius took an oath
of his soldiers that they would meet him at Ariminum by a
certain day. And afterwards (68), it appears that they
marched through Italy, and reached Ariminum in forty
days after leaving Lilybaeum.

b. Ariminum (Rimini): a very important city on the
coast of Umbria, a few miles south of the border of Cis-
alpine Gaul. It became a Roman colony in B.c. 268. As
a military post it was of the highest importance. for it was
situated just at the point towards Cisalpine Gaul where
the Apennines descend towards the Hadriatic, so that it
waS‚ in fact, the key to Cisalpine Gaul and the eastern
coast of Italy. Its value was soon greatly inereased by
the two great roads-—the Flaminian⁷ opened B.C. 221,
from Rome to Ariminum, (for a description of which see
Arnold’s Hist. of Rome, vol. iii. pp. 58-9‚) and the AEmi-
lian (13.c. 187), from Ariminum to Placentia.

c. supero mari.- the upper sea, or Hadriane, opposed to
the mare inferum.

LII. 3. per ambiguum savorem, “by espousing neither
side.‘'

7. a. Boiorum perfidiam .· see ch. xxv.

b. Sempronius. The construction is, “Sempronius cen-
sebat primos, qui eguissent ope, defensos esse maximum
vinculum continendis sociis in fide.”

9. a. unde, i. e. from the Carthaginian camp.

b. major tamen...s1cit‚ “yet on the whole the Romans
had the credit of vict01·y.’' The construction is, “fama
victoriae Romanis major suit quam (fama victoriae) hos-
tium.⁷’
