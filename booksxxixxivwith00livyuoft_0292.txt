premacy of Rome over the island, and he obtained a
triumph for it. Iu B.c. 215 Hampsicora, a native chief,
revolted, but his son Hiostus was defeated by Manlius.
A second battle was fought at Caralis (Caglfari), in which,
though alded by a Carthaginiau force, the Sardiuians were
again beaten, Hasdrubal taken prisoner, and Hiostus slain.
Hampsicora put an end to his own life. Vid. xxiii. 32,
40, 41.

b. Corsos. At the beginning of the first Punic war
Corsica was subject to Carthage. L. Scipio, in Β.ο. 259,
took Aleria, one ofits chief cities‚ and the island nominally
became subject to Rome. The Corsicans were never dan-
gerous enormes, but it was not until nearly the eud of the
Republie that they were effectually subdued.

c. Histros. A piratical people occupying the triangular-
shaped peninsula at the head of the Adriatic. They were
reduced by M. Minucius Rufus (Fabius’s magister equi-
tum) and P. Scipio Asina, 13.C. 221, in a single campaign.

d. Illyrios. In various tribes this people occupied the
whole east coast of the Adriatic. They had long been
formidable as pirates, but the fall of the Epirot power left
them without restraint. At last some Roman ambassa-
dors, who had been sent to demand reparation, having been
put to death by Teuta, the Illyrian queen, war was de-
clared3 and in ss.c. 229 a Roman army, under Cu. Fulvius
Centumalus and L. Plotius Albinus, crosscd the Adriatic
sor the first time, aud soon reduced her to terms. On
Teuta's death, Demetrius of Pharus, who had assisted the
Romans iu the first Illyrian war, having usurped the su-
preme power, and committed several hreaches of the
treaty, war was again declat-ed (13.c. 219), and in a short
time the consuls, L.AE1nili11s Paullus and M. Livius,
took Pharus, (Pol. iii. 18,) and received the submissiou of
all Illyria.
