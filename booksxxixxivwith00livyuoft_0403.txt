sides ineasures were being taken sor the public good.’'

9. c. ne libera efferatur res, i. e. ne ex libera fiat effera,
“lest after having become free, the state be hurried away
into licence.’' This is the natural meaning of the passage.
See Cic. Tusa, iv, 17. Some take efferatur in the sense of
intereat, “ come to an end‚'’ “perish ;” but the word is not
used so absoluteiy in this way.

XXIII. 2. comitia prcetornm creandi sunt habita. The
construction of this sentence is most unusual, though not

proetoribzts creandis habita.

dina.⁷’ Tradita est = translata est.

se parere. The omission is harsh.

8. sed quod rolebant non quam maturato opus erat navi-
ter expediebant, “but they did not set about finding the
means of effecting that which they wished so earnestly as
the occasion required.’' The construction is, non (tam)
naviter expediebant (id) quod volebant quam opus erat ma-
turato. Naviter. See above, ch. xiv. ξ 7. Quam maturato
opus erat = quam erat maturandum See Bk. 1. ch. lviii.
