b. unus ex iis. Polybius tells the same story, vi. 58.
So Cic. De Off. i. 133 but Acilius (mentioned by Cic.

tissent, eadem fraude ut jurejurando liberarentur? See
ch. lxi.

LIX. 4. a. se a Gallis auro redemisse. See Bk.v. ch.
xlviii.

b. legatas,- C. Fabricius and others.—Tarentnm. This

obtain from Pyrrhus an interchange of prisoners taken in
the battle of Heraclea.

c. nec supersumus nisi, 450„ “and we survive only be-
cause‚” διε.

9. tamen, “notwithstanding all I have urged.''
10. me dius fidius. See Bk. 11. ch. xxxi. Fidius is a

sui-name of Jupiter, and the whole expression = ‘⁴ me deus

b. praedibus ac praediis. A praes was any one who gave
security for another in a civil action; and apraedium was
originally any property given in security by a prees. Hence
proedibus ae praediis cavendum populo means that the people
were to be secured from loss by bondsmen (sureties) and.
their property. Such property was usually land, and hence
the common acceptation ofpraedium.
