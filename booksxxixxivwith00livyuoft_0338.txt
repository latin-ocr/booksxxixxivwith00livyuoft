8. Vioedum omnes, asser, “scarceiy had all got on board,
before some casting loose the hawsers (resolutis oris), stand
out to their anchors, (i. e. until brought to by their an-
chors); others, that there might be nothing to hold them,
cut their cables‚'' διο. Τ110 ships were near the beach,
anchored seaward from the prows, and made fast to the
shore by hawsers from their sterns. oris, “the hawsers
from the 510111 10 1110 shore.” anclwralia, “the cables of
the anehors.''

XX. 1. inseqmcli...cepere. According to the present
text it would appear that the Romans captured all the
vessels which had not run ashore, but the negative mm is
evidently Wrongly retained ι some of the Carthaginian ships
escaped up the river, others ran ashore and were hauled
osf by the Romans.

3. Onusam, al. Honoscam. Nothing is known of 1110
place under either name.

4. Longunticam. This place is also unknown. There
was a district near Carthago Nova, called Spartarius Campus,
which produced a peculiar kind of long grass (spartum)
used for making ropes and mats. Longuntica may have
been the place where this materia] was shipped.

5. Ebusum insulam. One of the Pityusae insulae. There
were two islands close together, which were often confound-
ed, as has probably been done by Livy here, under one
name. The larges was called Ebusus (Inita), the smaller
Ophiusa (Eumenem-a), They were about 100 miles from
the nearest Spanish promontory. The Balearic islands lie a

good deal farther to the east, and did not anciently inciude - ⁸

Ebusus and Ophiusa, though in the modern sense they do.
The islands were taken possession of for the Romans by
Q. Caecilius Metellus, surnalned Balearicus, B.c. 123.
