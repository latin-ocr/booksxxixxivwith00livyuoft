ch. xxv.-xxix. LIVY. 63

XXVII. l. a. magistri equitum-..soliti sunt. See Bk.
v111. ch. xxxii. et seqq.

-d, b. deorum hominumque judicio. Deorum, because they
had given him (Minucius) success over Hanniba13 homi-
num, for the senate’s decree had shewn how unpopular
Fabius‘s policy was.

3. a. ilaque se...ce-ssurum. The construction is, “itaque
se volentem nunquam cessurum parte gerendarum rerum
consilio qua posset (non cedere). Lit., “he would never
willingly withdraw from that share of conducting matters
prudently‚ srom which he could help withdrawing.'’

b. nec se...divz·surum, “he would divide the army with
him, but not the periods or days of eommand.”

XXVIII. 1. suo modo, “in his own way‚’¹ “as he
pleased;'' or, “in his usual way,'’ i. e. fraude atque in-
sidiis.

4. natus tegendis insidiis. See above, eh. iv. § 2.

6. ac sibi quisque...ad Iocum capiendum. This pune-
tuation is probably right, but instead of “ ad locum capi-
endum,'' we should probably read ac. The only sense
possible irom the present text is, “with a view to the
occupation of the place.’'

10. recta, “ sront to front.'’

11. Sed exorti. The order ιε, “Sed insidiatores exorti
repente, incursantes utrimque in latera ab tergoque fece-
runt eum tumultum terroremque ut,’' Sco.

XXIX. 3. a. conversi in hostem, “facing about.’'—vol-
ventes orbem. So Bk. 11. eh. l., orbem colligere.

b. palam ferente, “plainly shewing.'' serre is used in
nearly the same sense in Bk. 1v. ch. xlv. So perhaps
above, ch. xiv. note 10.

4. eum primum esse virum qui ipse consulat. Hesiod,

quoted by Arist. Eth. Nic. i. 2: —
